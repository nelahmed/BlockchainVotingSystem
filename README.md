# BlockchainVotingSystem
CSCI 5858 Term Project
This project is a Python application that simulates a blockchain-based voting system. Each vote is treated as a transaction and stored irreversibly in blocks on a local blockchain. One vote per registered voter is implemented by the program.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd17f059-5e29-48fa-8eda-f48aa2cd144a)
